# Welcome to my Github Profile üëã

My name is Harrison Seaborn and I am a full-stack web developer. I am currently seeking new remote opportunities. My skills include HTML, CSS, LESS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node, Python, Unit Testing, and Deployment. I most recently worked as a Team Lead for [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) where I was responsible for Leading a Team of Full Stack Developers, through their journey to learn the necessary skills needed, to gain employment in their given field of study. I am currently working on a 1 month long team project to help contribute to the Story Squad application. Story Squad turns ‚Äúreluctant readers‚Äù into authors and illustrators through a collaborative world-building game. This game allows users to read, write, draw and compete against others students.[StorySquad](https://github.com/orgs/Lambda-School-Labs/teams/labs-28-a-storysquad/repositories)
